# temp1
In the practice pull requests repository, git push was not working, so I created a new repository named 'temp' and cloned it using the SSH method, and did 'yes' where it asked and now it is working, and now I am creating this repository to clone using normal https and then check if push command works, if it does, there is some problem with practice pull requests repository!
